The city council is governed in its procedure by the provisions of chapters 2 and 3 of the city charter and Roberts Rules of Order (Newly Revised Edition) except where otherwise provided by the charter or by this chapter. The council may make and change its own rules from time to time by resolution duly adopted and any such changes supersede Roberts Rules of Order (Newly Revised Edition) and any previously adopted rules to the extent they conflict with the new rules. The council may, as part of its rules, impose on itself specific voting requirements related to the adoption and amendment of its rules including, but not limited, that such actions must be approved by more than a majority of the council. Any such specific voting requirements must be clearly identified in the rules. Rules adopted by the council shall remain in effect until changed, repealed, or superseded by council action. The most current version of the council rules shall be posted on the cityâ€™s website and a copy shall be available in the meeting room during regular and special council meetings. The presiding officer may speak on any question being considered, and has the rights, privileges, and duties of any other member of the council. The presiding officer may temporarily yield the chair to introduce or second a motion, resolution or ordinance. (Amended, Ord. No. 2015-03)
