	Subdivision 1. Laws of Minnesota 1994, chapter 646, Laws of Minnesota 1995, chapter 8, and Minnesota Statutes, section 205.07 (collectively, the "Act") require the city to modify the election system provided for in chapter 4 of the city charter to provide for the election of members of the city council in either odd-numbered years or even-numbered years, but not both.

	Subd. 4. The city staff has prepared a schedule of elections and terms that will enable the city to comply with the Act. The recommended schedule, embodied in subd. 5, is approved.
