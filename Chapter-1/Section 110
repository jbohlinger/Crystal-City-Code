110.01. Ordinances; enactment. Ordinances are enacted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the city charter. Ordinances are to be integrated into this code in accordance with this section.

110.03. Form of amendments and new ordinances. An ordinance amending this code must specify the subsection, subdivision and clause to be amended. Language to be added must be underlined; language to be repealed must be stricken. An ordinance repealing an entire chapter, section, subsection, subdivision or clause

110.05. Headnotes, etc. Chapter, section, subsection and subdivision headnotes, titles and cross referencesare not substantive parts of this code, but merely matters to expedite and simplify its use.

110.07. Integration of ordinances into code. 
 Subdivision 1. Duties of manager and attorney. The manager and city attorney must recommend to the council a system for integrating ordinances into the code in the most expeditious manner possible. They must recommend to the council rules consistent with this section for the preparation, editing and format of ordinances to be presented to the council.

 Subd. 3. Errors. When integrating ordinances into the code, the manager and attorney may correct manifest grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors; change reference numbers to conform with sections, subsections, chapters and ordinances; substitute figures for written words and vice versa; substitute dates for the words "the effective date of this ordinance"; and perform like actions to insure a uniform code of ordinances without, however, altering the meaning of the ordinances enacted.
 Subd. 4. Source notes. When an ordinance is integrated into this code, a source note must be added at the end of each new chapter, section, subsection or subdivision indicating the ordinance number and section from which the changed language was derived.
