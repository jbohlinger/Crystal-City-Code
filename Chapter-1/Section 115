115.07. Failure of officers to perform duties. The penalty imposed by this section does not apply to the failure of an officer or employee of the city to perform a duty imposed by this code unless a penalty is specifically provided for such failure.

115.09. Misdemeanor defined. For purposes of this code, the term "misdemeanor" means an offense or crime that the council is empowered to punish with fine or imprisonment, and a petty misdemeanor as defined by law.
